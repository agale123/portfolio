            I'm a Senior Software Engineer with experience in web development,
            full-stack development, and data analytics. Recently, I've been
            exploring sports analytics and exploring how to creatively visualize
            data. I enjoy building high quality products with a user-centered
            focus. I put a strong emphasis on code health and building easy to
            maintain systems. Languages and frameworks I have the most
            experience with include TypeScript, Python, C++, Java, Angular and
            Matplotlib.

                Drove large swaths of a massive migration from AngularJS to
                Angular which involved rewriting parts of the application shell,
                inverting the bootstrapping order of the two frameworks, and
                methodically turning down all aspects of the old framework.
                Stabilized routing across our dual bootstrapping setup and our
                microservices architecture. Most work utilized Angular
                TypeScript.

                important to determine which outcomes were feasible. To
                supplement this, I wrote scripts to calculate how teams could

                Courses included Data Visualization, Data Management for Data
                Science, Scalable Data Systems & Algorithms, and Statistical
                Machine Learning. This program was heavily project based, and
                allowed me to explore different data visualization technologies
                like R, Python, and Tableau as well as different data
                warehousing solutions. Outside of my coursework, I also began
                exploring sports analytics and visualization.

                of Algorithms, Data Science, Database Management Systems, and
                Machine Learning. Served as a teaching assistant for several
                classes, which required leading lab sections, assisting
                students, and grading student projects. During this time, I also
                completed two internships at Microsoft and one at Facebook.
